		<h1>Tradition and Cultural Elitism</h1>
		<p>
			Often times people will say they do something simply because it is a tradition.
			"My family always eats this food on Thanksgiving; it's a tradition". "Me and
			my friends always go out to this restaurant on New Years; it's a tradition".
			These little quirks of society are interesting and if nothing else a nice excuse
			to do something out of the ordinary.
		</p>
		<p>
			But tradition can quickly go south. I'm not talking about lighthearted family
			rituals; "implicit tradtion", so to speak, is what I refer to. By implicit I mean
			it is not explicitly described as tradition, and not practiced or observed the same way.
			For example, eating out with friends on New Years would be an explicit tradition,
			but the celebrating of New Years as a holiday an implicit one. Nobody says "New Years is
			a tradition for us". People simply celebrate it (or don't). These implicit traditions can
			be things like holidays, but they can also be things like keeping in place the status quo.
			One could say capitalism is an implicit tradition. That gets to the other part of my definition:
			not "complying" with an implicit tradition is seen as abnormal. Anybody in this day and age
			who publicly proclaims "I oppose capitalism" is immediately branded as a heretic and a radical,
			simply for going against an established norm; an implicit tradition.
		</p>
		<p>
			And implicit tradtions can be much more than just a way of doing things. Consider the 19th century.
			At that point in time, racism was a fact of life that people simply accepted: Black people were considered
			inferior to Whites, slavery was considered just. Racism here could be said to be an implicit tradition:
			people accept and practice racism without thinking about it (note the lack of past tense here). Anyone
			who had the courage to come out as antiracist was immediately branded a radical and not taken as seriously
			as someone who was racist and discriminatory.
		</p>
		<p>
			This gets to my second point: cultural elitism. Elitism is defined as the belief that a certain group of people
			are superior to others, and that considering only their opinions and needs is beneficial for society. When
			policies are passed that benefit the rich and harm the poor, that is elitism. Here I propose the subdivison
			of elitism into categories: economic elitism when you believe the rich matter more than the poor, for example.
			(This is probably not a new idea, and I acknowledge that). Just as we classify gender racism and cultural racism,
			so we can classify gender elitism and cultural elitism. The latter is what I will speak about here. Using the above defition,
			cultural elitism could be defined as the belief that a certain culture is better than all others, and only it
			should be considered in societal decision making. I am using culture here not as a culture of a nation but simply
			as that of a group of people, like (to use an 80s analogy) punk and goth. Cultural elitism is thus the belief
			that a certain group's beliefs are more important than another's.
		</p>
		<p>
			This idea can be extended to tastes, which if you think about it are just cultural beliefs. A common refrain I 
			hear (and that I unfortunately have preached myself) is that Rap as a genre is "not real music" or inferior to other
			genres. This boils down to cultural elitism: people preaching this idea are demeaning Rap and the culture around it,
			and uplifting whatever culture they are criticizing it from. And this is not just applicable to music: any demeaning
			of culture, be it saying that Rap is not real music or that Anime is simply veiled pronography (believe it or not,
			I have actually heard this said multiple times!) is cultural elitism. This may seem harmless on the surface, if a bit
			harsh: the worst that could happen is that someone who is a fan of Rap or Anime would get angry at you. But it can
			be so much more than that. When I demean Rap as inferior to other music or as an illegitimate form of expression,
			I am at the same time demeaning the culture around it and the ideas it expresses, which usually are outspokenly
			antiracist, egalitarian, and trying to raise awareness about social issues. In saying Rap is not real music or is
			an inferior form of culture I am in most cases being racist, whether I intend to or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			How do these two ideas overlap? The answer is simple: implicit traditions from the basis for most, if not all,
			cultural elitism. As an example, let's consider Brian Eno. In an interview with Musician Magazine, Eno
			said of modern music (modern for the time the interview was recorded, the 80s): "I don’t claim originality, but 
			I do hope other people use found materials in the future instead of writing cruddy songs like they do now"
			(Source: <a href="https://musicaficionado.blog/2017/05/03/listening-wind-by-talking-heads/">Music Aficiando</a>).
			Eno here is generalizing most music from that time period, aside from a bit of (in his opinion) "acceptable"
			music, as "cruddy songs". This is a prime example of cultural elitism: Eno here considered the subset of music
			that he created and enjoyed as superior to all the other "cruddy songs" of the 80s, and openly expressed the hope
			that this form of "cruddy" music would die off, replaced by his idea of good music. Where did he get his definition
			of good? Implicit traditions. Eno created and listened to a subset of music regularly. (I am not the most informed
			on his work, but a cursory search suggests that by the early 80s he was mostly involved with Ambient and African
			music). He internalized this subset as the "default" for music, and judged other forms of music relative to it.
			It may not sound like it, but this is an implicit tradition: Eno just believed that his subset of music was better,
			for no reason other than that in the past he had believed it was better. (This is an implicit tradition he constructed
			himself, which is actually not too uncommon).
		</p>
		<p>
			The above example should at least begin to show how cultural elitism and implicit traditions can overlap and often
			do so, the latter forming a basis for the former and the former feeding and encouraging a negative form of the latter.
			As well, this dynamic duo often overlaps with forms of discrimination like cultural racism, leading people to
			be discriminatory with or without realizing it. So why do people still "commit" cultural elitism or keep harmful
			implicit traditions? It's a bit of a feedback loop: having these harmful implicit traditions and being culturally
			elitist is an implicit tradition. It's a "natural thing" for people to judge forms of expression through a lense
			composed of a small subset of artwork, as with Brian Eno. People accept this and don't even think to question it.
			But no one wants to admit they do something just because it's "normal". Cosmo Landesman writes in The Spectator:
			"I like that degree of unreasonable passion. The intensity of our feelings for certain works of art should make us 
			intolerant of or at least infuriated with each other. It’s the price we pay for having a cultural life that matters. 
			Attack my taste, by all means: call me a pseud, dismiss me as dumb, dump me and tell me I deserve to die for liking 
			Toto’s ‘Africa’. In short, make war on my taste. That tells me you care about what I think and love". Here, they are
			describing cultural elitism as simply a passion for something (Quote taken from 
			<a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/in-praise-of-cultural-elitism">here</a>. I would recommend reading this
			article; it's a prime example of cultural elitism not hidden behind the veil of implicit tradition). This is simply
			them rationalizing and justifying their acceptance of the cultural status quo. Saying "I'm not discriminating, I'm
			just expression my intense love of a subset of culture" is a lot less embarrasing than admitting "I honestly just
			accept that cultural elitism is a thing".
		</p>
		<p>
			This justifying of cultural elitism leads to a lack of change. If you believe something for no reason other than
			an implicit tradition, but think you have a legitimate reason for believing it, then changing your belief seems
			ridiculous. Why stop believing something when you think you have a good reason to believe it? When someone's
			supposed reasons are debunked, they simply fabricate new ones. Why? Simply because change is scary. If you have
			believed something as long as you can remember, it can be tough to give it up, regardless of how irrational it is.
		</p>
		<p>
			But this cycle has to be broken if we are to stop being culturally elitist and stop harboring implicit cultural traditions.
			Luckily, doing this is simple enough: if we can just recognize our own implicit traditions and instances of cultural
			elitism, and just ask ourselves "am I justified in believing this?", we will find that we are much more compelled
			to make something right when the answer is no. Someone who hates Rap will probably not listen if you say to them
			"you just believe that because of cultural elitism and implicit tradition". But if they tell themselves that, chances
			are something will change. This conversion of implicit to explicit conversions forces us to have conversations with
			ourselves and reimagine our worldviews.
		</p>
		<p>
			To summarize: implciit traditions are formed when we believe something for no reason other than that it is "normal"
			to do so, but don't explicitly classify it thus. Cultural elitism is when someone demeans one culture in favor
			of another. The two often feed into discrimination and racism, and form a vicious cycle of justifying, demeaning,
			and the status quo. But with a bit of introspection, we can change all of that for the better.
