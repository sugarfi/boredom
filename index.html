		<h1>Writing for when I'm Bored</h1>
		<p>
			This is where I'll post musings on various topics when I have nothing better to do. I'm not gonna add
			any CSS and there might be spelling errors, but honestly I don't care too much; the content is what
			I'm worried about. If you find something I write offensive or inaccurate, email me at 
			<a href="mailto:sugarfi@sugarfi.dev">sugarfi@sugarfi.dev</a> and I will correct it.
